### What I learned

Focusing on repetition, I've learned to get alot more comfortable and confident in my logic as far as Javascript. I am getting comfortable with making features come alive. Also this right here which is storing data into an object, i really love this concept and will continue to use this. 


```JS storing data into an object
const pages = [
  {copy: "brooklyns design", background:"#bceaea", circle: "#3e78ed"},
  {copy: "Kanye West", background:"#a1fffe", circle:"#e34a47"},
  {copy: "October", background:"#d3c7f3", circle:"#f7fe00"},
  {copy: "download pdf", background:" #faffb8", circle:"#b472e6"},
  {copy: "pages", background:"#b472e6", circle:"#f7fe00"}
];
